"""SafeSerial class for thread-safe serial communication.

The :class:`~cc_hardware.drivers.safe_serial.SafeSerial` class is a wrapper around the
`serial.Serial \

class that provides a thread-safe interface for reading and writing to a serial device.
It also provides a few convenience methods for reading and writing data.
